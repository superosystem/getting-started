# TSX FORUM

TSX FORUM is somewhat similar in style to other forum applications, such as StackOverflow and Bitcointalk.org. A user will be able to post a topic or ask a question and receive responses from other users in the application's community.

This could have demonstrated JavaScript development by building several smaller simpler applications. The problem with demonstrating full-stack programming with simple apps is that they do not show all the capabilities of a modern JavaScript application. In other words, it could leave holes in your knowledge of how to implement certain features, such as authentication or database access.

TSX FORUM application will give us a good depth of understanding of the myriad frameworks necessary in a large full-stack application. It will also show the kind of features we need to implement in an app that will serve many users in a publicly accessible website. At a high level, we will be implementing the following technology features: 

- Security
- Session and Cookies
- Object Relational Mapper
- Database access and repository layer

## Features

- Auth
  - Login and logout: This feature will include not only the GraphQL resolvers to allow logging in and logging out, but also the screens to allow the user to enter their ID and password. We will also be using several technologies to provide a unique session state for the user's activities at any given time.
  - Registration system:  A registration system will include both screens and resolvers that allow a user to create a unique account in order to distinguish their activities on the site.
  - Password reset: The ability for users to change their password when required, but in a secure way.
  - Profile screen: A screen and features that show a user's account information. This information will include their email and user ID. In addition to that, it provides the ability for the user to view all of their prior posts, including both topic posts and responses.
  - Categories: Groupings based on categories should be created to allow users to view only the posts in categories that they are interested in and reduce noise.
  - Notification emails: A system for contacting users via email and notifying them of additional requirements or news about the site. For example, this could include a verification email that checks that the email they registered with is valid and accessible by the same user.

- Thread Management
  - Topic thread posting and editing: This feature will, of course, include the ability to be viewed by anyone, as well as adding and editing topic posts by an author. Users will also be able to see all their posts from their UserProfile screen.
  - Responding to a thread topic: This feature will include the ability for the topic-starting user and other users to respond to a topic post with their own comments. It has the

- Thread Points System
  - Points system: A points system will be created to allow users to upvote or downvote thread postings and responses.
  - Display view count: Show the number of times a thread post was viewed by users.
  - Display response count: Show the number of responses a post has to let users know what topics are popular or trending.
